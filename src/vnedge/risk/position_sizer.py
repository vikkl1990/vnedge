"""Risk-based position sizing.

Size is derived from *how much we are willing to lose*, never from leverage:

    quantity = (equity * risk_per_trade) / |entry - stop|

Leverage is then computed as the margin-efficiency consequence of that size
and validated against the configured caps, including the liquidation buffer:
a stop that would never be reached because the position liquidates first is
not a stop, and such orders are rejected here.
