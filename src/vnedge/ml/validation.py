"""Robust validation — the anti-overfit toolkit for ML promotion.

For a trading model, "high quality" is not a bigger network; it is a HONEST
out-of-sample claim. The last ML attempt overfit (IS +$1,343 vs OOS -$18.50)
and was correctly rejected by the IS/OOS collapse gate. This module makes that
rejection quantitative and systematic, so a model is promoted only when the
edge is measurably unlikely to be a selection artifact.

Every ML role (meta-labeling, regime, standalone direction) validates through
here BEFORE any pre-registered untouched-window judgment. Nothing here trades;
it only measures. References: Bailey & Lopez de Prado, "The Deflated Sharpe
Ratio" (2014); Bailey et al., "The Probability of Backtest Overfitting" (2015);
Lopez de Prado, "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" (2018).

Two independent guards, because they catch different failures:
  * DSR  — is a SINGLE strategy's Sharpe real, given how many configs we tried?
  * PBO  — across a FAMILY of configs, how often does the in-sample winner turn
           out below-median out-of-sample? (the definition of overfitting)
And CPCV gives many purged, embargoed OOS paths instead of one lucky split.
