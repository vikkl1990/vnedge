"""Paper fill model — deliberately pessimistic.

Market buys fill at ask plus slippage; market sells at bid minus slippage;
fees are always charged; limit orders fill only when price actually crosses,
and then at the limit price (never with imaginary improvement). Optional
deterministic partial fills for market orders (remainder is cancelled,
IOC-style) so partial-fill handling is testable without randomness.

If paper results look better than backtest results, the fill model is wrong.
