"""Risk configuration — the single source of truth for every risk limit.

Every limit here is enforced by the pre-trade risk gateway
(:mod:`vnedge.risk.risk_manager`). There is deliberately no code path that
places an order without passing through those checks.

Leverage policy (decided 2026-07-02):
    - Default per-position leverage is 5x.
    - Anything above 10x requires ``acknowledge_high_leverage=True`` — an
      explicit, written opt-in that the operator understands liquidation risk.
    - 30x is the absolute ceiling; config validation rejects higher values.
    - Position SIZE is always derived from risk-per-trade and stop distance,
      never from leverage. Leverage only determines margin efficiency.
