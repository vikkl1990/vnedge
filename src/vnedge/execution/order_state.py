"""Order state machine (docs/DESIGN.md §2).

Every order lives in exactly one state; transitions are whitelisted and
anything else raises. The state nobody else models properly is the one that
matters most:

    TIMEOUT_UNKNOWN — the order MAY have reached the exchange; we cannot
    confirm. It is never resolved by assumption, only by reconciliation
    (TIMEOUT_UNKNOWN -> RECONCILING -> a confirmed state). While any order
    is unresolved, the order manager blocks all risk-increasing orders.
