"""Strategy interface for the backtester (and later paper/live engines).

Contract that keeps lookahead bias structurally impossible:

- ``prepare()`` may use vectorized operations over the whole frame, but only
  causal ones (rolling windows, shifts backward). It must not leak future
  rows into earlier rows.
- ``signal(df, index)`` is called at the CLOSE of bar ``index`` and may read
  rows ``0..index`` only. The engine fills any resulting intent at the OPEN
  of bar ``index + 1`` — a strategy never trades on information from the bar
  it trades in.
- Every intent must carry a stop price. Stop-less strategies are not
  representable in this system by design.
