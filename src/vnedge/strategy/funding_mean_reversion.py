"""Candidate 2: funding-skew mean reversion.

Hypothesis: when funding is at a trailing extreme AND price is stretched
from its mean in the same direction, positioning is crowded and short-
horizon reversion toward the mean has positive after-cost expectancy —
UNLESS the market is in a clean trend (crowded can stay crowded in trends,
which is exactly when fading gets run over).

Entry (short; long mirrored):
- funding-rate percentile at a trailing extreme (longs paying richly)
- price z-score stretched above its rolling mean
- trend regime NOT up (do not fade clean trends)

Risk: ATR-multiple stop beyond the extension; take profit at the rolling
mean (the reversion target itself, not a fixed R).

Known failure modes: strong trends that keep paying funding for weeks,
short squeezes through the stop, regime filter lagging a fresh trend.
