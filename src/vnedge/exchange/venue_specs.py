"""Venue-specific fee tiers and contract specs — reality-checked against the
live exchange, not assumed from one Binance-shaped default.

Historically every lane (Binance, Bybit, Delta) shared ONE fee/limits config:
- fees: Binance USDT-M standard (taker 5.0 bps). Bybit's standard linear-perp
  taker is 0.055% = 5.5 bps, so every Bybit lane was modelled ~0.5 bps/side too
  cheap, overstating its edge.
- limits: a BTC-shaped ``min_qty=qty_step=0.0001`` for EVERY symbol. Real Bybit
  lot steps are 10x-10000x larger for altcoins (DOGE trades in whole coins), so
  sizing produced quantities Bybit would re-round or reject.

The Bybit contract specs below were verified against the Bybit V5
``/v5/market/instruments-info?category=linear`` API on 2026-07-24. Funding
interval is 480m (8h) for all of these symbols, so the codebase-wide 8h funding
assumption is correct for our universe (kept as a note, not a code path).

Non-Bybit venues fall through to the historical defaults, so this module only
changes Bybit lane economics — Binance and Delta behaviour is unchanged.
