# Scalper Parameter Registry

`vnedge.scalping.parameter_registry` is the frozen source of truth for scalper
research parameters. It does not trade or promote anything. It defines what
the L2 research loop is allowed to test.

## Context, Execution, And Horizons

The registry separates context from execution.

Context timeframes:

- `4h`: macro regime / side avoidance
- `1h`: volatility, funding, session context
- `15m`: structure and local pressure zones
- `1m`: setup confirmation / candle context

Execution/replay timeframes:

- event-driven tape
- `250ms`
- `500ms`
- `1s`
- `3s`
- `5s`
- `15s`
- `30s`
- `60s`
- `1m_research_proxy`

The `1m` context lane is human-readable setup context. The
`1m_research_proxy` lane is only a candle approximation for fee-wall testing.
Neither is promotion-quality proof for scalping. True scalper validation is
tick/L2 replay.

## Families

V1 families:

- `book_imbalance_continuation`
- `forced_flow_continuation`
- `absorption_reversal`
- `microprice_dislocation`
- `liquidity_vacuum_continuation`
- `volatility_impulse`

Each family owns its horizon set, flow thresholds, spread limits, sample
requirements, route gates, and exit policy. Parameter changes should be code
reviewed because they alter the research contract.

## Fees And Route Hurdles

The registry stores maker/taker/slippage/safety-buffer assumptions per venue.
Route gates remain conservative:

- maker route requires positive net bps and PF above the maker floor
- taker route requires enough extra PF/net bps to cover higher entry cost
- below the floor means `BLOCKED`, not a weak signal

## Context Mining

The alpha factory now tags every structural hypothesis with one of:

- `aligned`
- `mixed`
- `hostile`
- `missing`

Those tags are mined as evidence splits. They do not approve, reject, or trade
by themselves. The question they answer is: does the same L2 pattern clear
fees only when `4h/1h/15m/1m` context agrees with the scalp side?

## Exit Intelligence

Current live safety:

- reduce-only exits remain allowed through the gateway
- tick stops are available as risk infrastructure
- replay static exits use stop/target/TTL at tradable touch prices

Smart-exit replay policies:

- `static_fast`: stop + target + TTL; live-wired baseline
- `adverse_cut`: exits early when post-fill adverse selection breaches a
  tighter threshold before the static stop
- `adaptive_trail`: activates a trailing exit after favorable movement and
  can lock partial profit on retrace

Replay diagnostics can compare policies directly:

```bash
python -m vnedge.research.scalper_replay_diagnostics \
  --day 20260705 \
  --family-id liquidity_vacuum_continuation \
  --exit-policy adaptive_trail
```

Replay rows include `exit_policy_id` and `exit_reason_counts`, so smart exits
must prove themselves as actual `adverse_cut` or `trail` closes, not just as
configured intent.

The registry reports an exit-intelligence score. The honest status is:

- live path: developing/static
- replay path: adaptive policies can now be measured
- production scalper: not smart-exit-ready until the hot loop wires the
  chosen policy into reduce-only order generation

## Runtime Visibility

The decoupled L2 loop publishes the registry in:

```text
research/live_research/l2_latest.json.scalper_parameter_registry
```

The hourly candle loop folds the same payload into:

```text
research/live_research/latest.json.scalper_parameter_registry
```
